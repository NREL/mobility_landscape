              The Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification enables infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs) to make harmonized work zone data available
              for third party use. The intent is to make travel on public roads safer and more efficient through ubiquitous access to data on work zone
              activity. Specifically, the project aims to get data on work zones into vehicles to help automated driving systems (ADS) and human drivers
              navigate more safely.

              Infrastructure projects require careful planning and management to ensure that projects and services are carried out according to the project
              specifications. Whether you work on paving roads or focus on private sector projects, infrastructure projects keep people moving safely. From
              critical infrastructure highway maintenance, to traffic control inspections, infrastructure forms and apps help ensure that infrastructure
              planning teams stay organized. All infrastructure PDFs can be customized for different infrastructure planning needs. The apps cover critical
              infrastructure planning checklists, risk management network infrastructure reports and project needs, asset management tools and other services.

              and to give municipalities the ability to express regulation in machine-readable formats.

              The Route Energy Prediction Model (RouteE) was developed under ARPA-e TRANSNET and SMART Mobility - CAVs. Applications include vehicle route
              selection, energy accounting and optimization in transportation simulation, and corridor energy analyses, among others. This tool is applicable in
              any situation where past, present, or future trip information is available, and does not require high-resolution (i.e. 1 Hz+) like what is
              required to run a powertrain simulation.

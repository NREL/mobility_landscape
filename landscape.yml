              The Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Specification enables infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs) to make harmonized work zone data available
              for third party use. The intent is to make travel on public roads safer and more efficient through ubiquitous access to data on work zone
              activity. Specifically, the project aims to get data on work zones into vehicles to help automated driving systems (ADS) and human drivers
              navigate more safely.

              activity. Specifically, the project aims to get data on work zones into vehicles to help automated driving systems (ADS) and human drivers
              navigate more safely.

              The Route Energy Prediction Model (RouteE) was developed under ARPA-e TRANSNET and SMART Mobility - CAVs. Applications include vehicle route
              selection, energy accounting and optimization in transportation simulation, and corridor energy analyses, among others. This tool is applicable in
              any situation where past, present, or future trip information is available, and does not require high-resolution (i.e. 1 Hz+) like what is
              required to run a powertrain simulation.

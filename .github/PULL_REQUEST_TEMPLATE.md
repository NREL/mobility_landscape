### Pre-submission checklist:

*Please check each of these after submitting your pull request:*

* [ ] Are you only including a `repo_url` if your project is 100% open source? If so, you need to pick the single best GitHub repository for your project, not a GitHub organization.
* [ ] Is your project closed source or, if it is open source, does your project have at least 300 GitHub stars?
* [ ] Have you picked the single best (existing) category and subcategory for your project?
* [ ] Does it follow the other guidelines from the [new entries](https://github.com/NREL/mobility_landscape#new-entries) section?
* [ ] Have you included a URL for your SVG or added it to `hosted_logos` and referenced it there?
* [ ] Does your logo follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/NREL/mobility_landscape#logos)?
* [ ] Does your project/product name match the text on the logo?
* [ ] Have you ensured that all of your filter variables meet the standards of other entries?
* [ ] ~15 minutes after opening the pull request, the CNCF-Bot will post the URL for your staging server. Have you confirmed that it looks good to you and then added a comment to the PR saying "LGTM"?
